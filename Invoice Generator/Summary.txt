ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement: Invoice Generator

We want to design a system that can generate invoices for customer purchases in a shop/e-commerce setting.

ðŸŽ¯ Requirements:
	1.	An Invoice should contain:
        â€¢	Customer details (name, ID, address).
        â€¢	List of purchased items (each with name, quantity, price).
        â€¢	Total cost (with taxes applied).
	2.	The system should:
        â€¢	Calculate the total amount.
        â€¢	Apply different types of tax calculations (e.g., GST, VAT, Service Tax).
        â€¢	Support different output formats for invoices (e.g., PDF, Excel, Print, Email).
	3.	Extendability:
        â€¢	Tomorrow, if a new tax system is introduced, we should be able to add it without modifying existing classes (OCP).
        â€¢	If a new output format (say JSON export) is added, it should not break the existing design.
	4.	Responsibilities must be separated:
    	â€¢	Invoice data handling should not be mixed with tax calculation or saving/exporting. (SRP).
